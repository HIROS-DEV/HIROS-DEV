## Learning something new everyday

Hello, I’m Aurélie, a developer from France. I started studying web development with the help of The Odin Project. Using the vast list of resources they offer, I was able to obtain new learning skills as I studied web fundamentals and learnt to enjoy building responsive websites from scratch to bring new ideas to life in a browser. Striving to improve my skills, I then joined Ecole O’Clock to aim for the French “Titre de développeur web et web mobile”.

Invested in a life-long learning mentality, I currently strive to join an innovative team where I could keep on growing both personally and professionally on a long-term period.

## What I am currently focusing on...
* Studying web development with [Ecole O'Clock](https://oclock.io/)
* Improving my MERN skills by building projects (currently working on a [chat application](https://lechat.vercel.app/) in my free time)
* Learning TypeScript
