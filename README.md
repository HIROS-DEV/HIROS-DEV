## Learning something new everyday

Hello, Iâ€™m Hiro, a developer from Japan. I started studying web development with the help of The Odin Project. Using the vast list of resources they offer, I was able to obtain new learning skills as I studied web fundamentals and learnt to enjoy building responsive websites from scratch to bring new ideas to life in a browser. 


## What I am currently focusing on...
* Improving my MERN skills by building projects (currently working on a [chat application](https://lechat.vercel.app/) in my free time)
