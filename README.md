## Learning something new everyday

Hello, Iâ€™m Hiro. 
I'm a 100% self-taught developer from Japan. 
I started studying web development with the help of The Odin Project. Using the vast list of resources they offer, I was able to obtain new learning skills as I studied web fundamentals and learnt to enjoy building responsive websites from scratch to bring new ideas to life in a browser.

## What I am currently focusing on...
* Improving my MERN skills by building projects (currently working on a facebook clone in my free time)
* I am learning GraphQL full stack. 
* I am learning algorithm in Code Wars.
